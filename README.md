Composer plugin for generate Drupal packages metadata into info files.

By default packages (e.g. modules, themes and profiles) downloaded from
<https://drupal.org/> will be injeted with metadata info its .info or
.info.yml, so update.module will able to figure out if corresponding
version installed are outdated or not. By the way, if you download
packages with GIT directly, e.g. install `-dev` release by using
Composer, such metadata info won't exists and so update.module will
report with unknown version.

This way you can:

  - Generate version information for `.info` files in ini format
  - Generate version information for `.info.yml` files in YAML format
  - Compute the rebulid version string for a project, by does some magic
    in Git to find the latest release tag along the branch we're
    packaging from, count the number of commits since then, and use that
    to construct this fancy alternate version string which is useful for
    the version-specific dependency support in Drupal 7 and higher

In case of Drupal 7.x, following metadata will be injected into `.info`
file:

    ; Information add by drustack/composer-generate-metadata on 2017-02-18
    project = "features"
    core = "7.x"
    version = "7.x-2.10+3-dev"
    datestamp = "1487399547"

In case of Drupal 8.x, following metadata will be injected into
`.info.yml` file:

    # Information add by drustack/composer-generate-metadata on 2017-02-18
    project: "features"
    version: "8.x-3.2+1-dev"
    datestamp: "1487399552"

## Installation

Simply install the plugin with composer:

    $ composer require drustack/composer-generate-metadata:~2.0

## Configuration

Drupal projects are not listed on Packagist. Instead, Drupal.org
provides its own directory of Drupal projects for Composer to use.
Therefore you will need to add Drupal.org as a Composer Repository to
your Drupal site's composer.json file.

Drupal.org provides two separate composer repository endpoints: one for
Drupal 7 and one for Drupal 8.

  - To use Composer with Drupal 7, use the repository url
    <https://packages.drupal.org/7>
  - To use Composer with Drupal 8, use the repository url
    <https://packages.drupal.org/8>

To add the repository from the command line you should execute the
following command from your repository root:

    $ composer config repositories.drupal composer https://packages.drupal.org/7

Composer will then automatically update your Drupal site's composer.json
file with a repositories object of the format:

    {
        "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "composer",
                "url": "https://packages.drupal.org/7"
            }
        ]
    }

## Example

An example composer.json:

    {
        "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "composer",
                "url": "https://packages.drupal.org/7"
            }
        ],
        "require": {
            "drupal/drupal": "~7.54",
            "drupal/features": "2.x-dev",
            "drustack/composer-generate-metadata": "~2.0"
        }
    }
